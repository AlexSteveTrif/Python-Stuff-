After reviewing the quarterly reports, Brooke realized she needed help. She decided to call an
old schoolmate, Jane, who was a partner in a small accounting firm. While Brooke searched for
Jane’s phone number, Jack, the manager responsible for Administration, Purchasing, and
Human Resources (HR), dropped by to show off his newest golf club, which one of the Coffee
Pot’s suppliers had just sent him. Brooke had grown to like Jack whom her dad, due to his
failing health, had hired a couple of years ago. Jack frequently provided her with free tickets to
concerts, hockey games, etc., which he received from suppliers.

Before Jack left her office, Brooke congratulated him on beating his previous quarter’s numbers
and, thus, earning his quarterly bonus. Jack often changed suppliers as he chased the lowest
prices; his purchasing strategy appeared to be working as purchasing costs were lower than last
year. His training expenses were also down, even though staff turnover was significantly higher
than last year.

Still sipping her morning coffee, Brooke begins to read the report Jane had just sent over. Jane
writes that she strongly supports Brooke’s strategy, but has three areas of concern:

1. The Coffee Pot had overpaid lease rentals in some malls.

Although Jane suspected no problems, The Coffee Pot, Inc. has never been audited.

3. Brooke’s biggest shock was reading that a recently hired manager in Peoria had doubled the
size of the shop by taking over the lease of the adjacent space and was serving pizza and
beer. The manager justified this to Jane by saying that due to the coffee bean quality he
needed to expand the shop’s product offerings.

Still unsure what to do, Brooke gets ready to leave for The Coffee Pot’s quarterly management
meeting. She is confident that her new strategy of offering quality, low-cost coffee to mall
shoppers is the right one, but is uncertain how to make it pay off.
